_Gold of The Great Steppe_{: .text-info } (28 September 2021 – 30 January 2022) will display an
archaeological sensation, hundreds of outstanding gold artefacts recently discovered
in the extraordinary ancient burial mounds built by the Saka people of East Kazakhstan.

The Saka culture of Central Asia, flourishing from the 8th-3rd centuries BCE, was
one of the earliest expressions of the Scythian world that dominated the Eurasian
steppe zone from the Black Sea to Siberia. Located in the Altai mountain system,
the Saka of East Kazakhstan were a vibrant society who occupied a landscape of
wide open skies, rolling plains, winding rivers and soaring mountains.

The spectacular artefacts were unearthed during an ongoing excavation by
archaeologists in the East Kazakhstan region, many of the discoveries were unearthed
during the pandemic, and represent the resilience and determination of Kazakhstani
archaeologists to protect and document their heritage, which is under threat from
looting and degradation due to climate change.

This exhibition will place archaeological finds discovered in the last three years by
Kazakh archaeologists on a global stage for the first time, amplifying voices that
often go unheard in museums in the west and giving UK audiences a unique opportunity
to discover the rich cultural history of this part of the world.
