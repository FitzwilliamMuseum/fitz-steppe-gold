The Gold of the Great Steppe project focuses on the East of Kazakhstan, part of the Great Steppe. The Great Steppe is a vast expanse of grassland that stretches for thousands of miles across Eurasia â€“ from eastern Siberia to the Black Sea. 

Located in the centre of this steppe zone, East Kazakhstan occupies a special ecological position. With the Altai mountain system at its borders, rivers, lakes and open steppe create many unique habitats for a huge variety of birds, plants, animals, and humans.
