In the 1st millennium BC, the Saka people of East Kazakhstan chose dramatic and prominent places to bury their dead in elaborate graves.

Who were the Saka, and how did they understand their world?


## The art of repetition

The Saka made hundreds and even thousands of near-identical plaques and other ornaments by hand in the distinctive ‘animal style’. Loops on the back indicate they were sewn onto clothing to form a shimmering outfit.

## East Kazakhstan Landscapes

All landscape images: Yevgeniy Domashev


Eleke Sazy is a vast cup-shaped valley surrounded by low mountains. Over 300 kurgans are set across high ground in a mosaic landscape of river, marsh, and steppe. Some date to the earliest Saka period (around 900 BC).

The burial grounds of Berel and Shilikti, and the settlement of Akbauyr, are also located in dramatic mountain and steppe locations.


## LANDSCAPES, PLACES, PEOPLE

Most of our direct evidence about the Saka comes from recent excavations of their cemeteries amidst the dramatic mountain backdrop of East Kazakhstan. Hundreds of burial mounds known as kurgans were built in lines along natural terraces and ridges, some as high as 3 storey buildings. The lavish burials are some of the earliest evidence of the Scythian culture that would dominate the Great Steppe from Siberia to the Black Sea. The Saka understood, exploited, and shaped this spectacular landscape through complex social interactions.


## A noble young archer

This Saka teenager was no older than 18 when he died. He was given an elite burial at the Eleke Sazy burial ground with a bow and arrows and a dagger. He was originally buried alongside a girl, most likely his sister, who was aged 13-14. Her grave was heavily looted, while his grave was hidden under a collapsed wall of the stone burial chamber. Archaeologists rarely discover intact Saka burials.

## Seven deer plaques

Shown as female deer without antlers, and accompanying the stag plaque that decorated the goytos. The representations of deer on precious objects in Kurgan 4 point to a deer cult among the Saka.

## Saka and Scythians.

The same people?

‘Above them dwelt the Arimaspi, men with one eye. Still further the gold-guarding Griffins’ (Herodotus, Hist. iv. 13)

Around 2,500 years ago the ancient Greeks and Persians gave vivid accounts of highly mobile, horse-mounted warrior peoples occupying the Great Steppe. In ancient Persian sources ‘Saka’ is used interchangeably with ‘Scythians’, although Saka are generally attributed to the easternmost peoples of the Great Steppe. Saka remains the term used in Kazakhstan today.

In the 5th century BC, Herodotus of Halicarnassus wrote his Histories. He uses the term ‘Scythians’ to describe those groups occupying the region north of the Black Sea, while also naming many other tribes to the east who wore the same clothes and shared the same culture.

Could the ‘gold-guarding Griffins’ be the Saka of East Kazakhstan? This exhibition includes depictions of the mythical griffin. We don’t know how the ancient peoples of East Kazakhstan referred to themselves, but we can explore the messages they give about their beliefs and society through their material culture.

## Tube located in cheek

Possibly used as part of an embalming process. The archer’s long bones were also neatly drilled after his death, as were those of the girl he was buried alongside, perhaps also part of preparing the body for burial.

## ‘Akinakes’ with snow leopard heads on the pommel and argali horns on the handle

The argali is a wild mountain sheep. Perhaps the dynamic of predator and prey gave power to the owner. This dagger was ritually ‘killed’ before it was buried by breaking it cleanly at the hilt.

## Population genetics in the Great Steppe

A recent genetic study has shown that the Saka emerged from the complex mixing of Bronze Age populations in the Great Steppe. They are related to other Scythian peoples such as the Sarmatians and the Sargat, but were among the earliest group to emerge from around 900 BC in the Altai region. All groups shared a common artistic tradition, and were skilled at horse riding.

The analysis of 111 ancient individuals from 39 sites across the Great Steppe has made significant advances in our understanding of how the Saka were related to other Scythian peoples. The study found that in the later Bronze Age (1400-900 BC) populations interacted across the steppe region, with three main Bronze Age gene pools identified. From these the Scythian peoples emerged. The study supports archaeologists’ interpretations of the material culture that movement and interaction between populations had been taking place for thousands of years across Central Asia.



## Nobility and wealth

Saka society was hierarchical, with leaders and elite families who controlled the land and resources. The presence of large and richly-furnished kurgans containing single or few individuals shows that only some members of society received a grand burial.

Teenagers buried with elaborate grave goods indicate that wealthy families were able to honour their dead.



## Arrowheads with gold cuffs

The gold decorative cuffs would make the arrows impractical to use, but gives them a special status for burial. These arrowheads were found in another kurgan near to the archer’s burial.

## Fragment of leather from gorytos

A remarkable survival from the archer’s grave, the fine leather bears the impressions of the arrows it contained.

Analysis of ancient proteins has revealed that quivers were commonly made from goat leather, however one Scythian gorytos from Ukraine was found to be made from human skin.

## Arrows with binding

Being an archer was an important part of Saka identity. The Eleke Sazy archer was buried with 40 identical arrows.

We assume he was also buried with a composite bow made from horn, wood and sinew that was designed to be fired from horseback. This has not survived.

## Bringing the past to life

As part of the research process archaeologists, costume designers, jewellers and other craftspeople work together to piece together evidence from excavations.

Reconstructions enable the full effect of the burial costumes to be imagined, bringing the Saka to life. Reconstructing the burial costumes of both horses and people is considered an important tool for public engagement and museum displays in Kazakhstan.

Each part of a reconstructed costume is carefully considered in relation to the original archaeological context. Making a reconstruction from archaeological material is like putting together a puzzle with lots of pieces missing, particularly since fragile materials such as textiles, wooden objects, and leather are often poorly preserved or do not survive at all. Archaeologists draw on a variety of different information sources to when making reconstructions including information from other archaeological artefacts and excavations, descriptions and depictions of the Saka made in antiquity, and elements of traditional Kazakh nomadic costume.



## Hinged weapons belt attachment

Showing the importance of horse riding in the lives of the Saka, as well as their skill in bronze working. The hinged design acts as a shock absorber to prevent weapons from hitting against the leg of a warrior while riding. Used to attach the young archer’s gorytos to his belt.

## Mobility and contact

Horses and horse riding were central to the Saka way of life. Their equestrian skill is demonstrated through the specialised horseriding equipment they made. The Saka and other Scythian groups commanded large territories, bringing them into contact and conflict with other peoples and cultures.

An inscription by the Persian king Darius I (522-486 BC) records the capture in battle of a Saka king named Skunkha.



## Horses in Saka society

The Saka were magnificent horse riders, known for their skill as mounted warriors.

Analysis of sophisticated Saka equine gear has shown it was ideal for use in fast raids or hunting. Studies of horse remains from burials have revealed that in the Saka world humans and horses lived, worked, fought, died, and were buried together. Horses also provided milk, meat, leather and hide, and could be used as beasts of burden.

The horses of the Altai region, where the burial grounds of Berel, Eleke Sazy and Shilikti are located, were medium to large sized ponies by today’s standard. In a kurgan up to seventeen horses might be placed north of the log chamber containing the human remains. Older horses are often buried with the most elaborate outfits, indicating that their long life was cherished by their human companions. Nearly all the horses from burials are male, and were either bay or chestnut in colour with no white markings.

## Horse outfit reconstruction, Berel cemetery

As well as being economically significant, horses were dressed in highly symbolic costumes for burial that turned them into shape-shifters and bearers of mythological messages.

Similar to those found at Pazyryk, each horse’s burial outfit is unique.

## The ‘animal style’

The ‘animal style’ is the name given to the depiction of animals in fluid, linear, abstract forms. It was widespread across the steppe. Art historians have tried to unpick the chronology of the animal style and have identified many regional traits, but it persisted for hundreds of years. The depiction of deer and bears, wild sheep and felines reflects the world-view of the steppe communities.

The Saka art in this exhibition is decorative, applied art made for portable and precious objects, notably clothing, weaponry, and horse tack. We also find carvings on rock faces and standing stones in the landscape. Its themes are mainly wild creatures – predators and prey – rather than humans or domestic animals. The Saka imply the dynamism of the animals, or capture the movement of their limbs, muscles, and bone structure.

Is the animal style a conventional visual language, passed on through innumerable generations and resonating with Saka mythology and religious beliefs? Or was the tradition also sustained by the constant observation of nature: ever-present and profoundly important?

## SYMBOLIC WORLD

Saka art depicts highly stylised and carefully executed motifs showing wild, domesticated, and mythical animals and birds in dynamic poses. These artworks hint at a rich symbolic language and mythological world that expressed their deep connection with nature and a sophisticated understanding of their spectacular environment.

We cannot fully understand the beliefs that the Saka held about the world around them.

By looking at what they chose to represent in their art we can begin to understand the things that might have had particular significance for them. The natural world is captured in the ‘animal style’ – carefully posed creatures with exaggerated features, which are often combined to form beautiful patterns and shapes. We do not understand their meaning, but we can appreciate the power of the message.


## Argali (mountain sheep) on clouds (5)

## Beliefs in life

Deer are frequently depicted in heraldic designs that form symmetrical patterns.

Predators curl and twist as they attack their prey. Mythical griffins with tiger stripes or horse hooves blur the realms of the real and imagined. People and horses were transformed and shape-shifted by wearing these glittering symbols. Animals, birds, fish, and plants are all found in Saka artistic expression. This hints at how they ordered the natural world, and the meanings they gave to the realms of the air, steppe, mountains, and water.



## Reclining snarling feline predator (snow leopard?)

The balance and opposition of hunters and the hunted seems to have been important in the Saka belief system.

From the same hoard as the argali on clouds, the energy and poise of the predators opposes the serenity of their prey.

## Beliefs around death

We can begin to understand Saka beliefs about death by studying the actions they took to bury their dead, and what they placed with them. Hoards of clothing and horse tack found under the external stones of kurgans were given as gifts to commemorate the dead long after burial.

This has parallels with the Kazakh custom of sacrificing a horse laden with the clothes of the deceased one year after their death.



## Horses and ceremony

Ornaments for horse tack were found in a hoard of over 800 objects hidden at the base of a kurgan at Eleke Sazy cemetery.

Unlike most delicate harness ornaments found in Saka-Scythian burials, the sturdily made objects were likely made for ceremonial use while the horse was alive.

Perhaps the long chains and leaf-life pendants on the claws of the feline predators would have created a soft tinkling sound as the horse moved.

This collection of jewellery and clothing decorations represents a complete hoard hidden together under the stones of the kurgan containing the teenagers at the Eleke Sazy cemetery. Archaeologists think gifts of clothing and jewellery were left for the dead in a ceremony of remembrance to mark the anniversary of their passing. A similar custom of giving clothes in memory of the deceased forms part of Kazakh burial rites today.

Kurgans are carefully planned structures. Archaeologists study how they were built to understand Saka beliefs and rituals. Most kurgans have a central burial chamber, either built in wood above the ground or sunk into deep pits and encased in a stone structure. Layers of earth, turf and stones are used to create the mound, which is sealed with a top layer of stones. Permafrost often forms inside the stone structure,creating excellent preservation conditions for wood, skin and leather.

Kurgan 4 at Eleke Sazy, where the Saka teenagers were buried, was reinforced with packed earth on its western side, perhaps to protect against a perceived spiritual threat from the setting sun. The archer was buried with his head pointing northwest.

One ring of large stones supports the layered earthen structure of turf, soil and mudbrick (crepidoma), and a double ring of beautifully coloured river stones was placed around the perimeter. The kurgan is encircled by a ditch, perhaps as the final act of ending the death ritual and ‘closing’ the monument.

## MATERIAL WORLD

A complex world of materials and production techniques underlies the social and symbolic world of the Saka. Through careful study of the artefacts, archaeologists have begun to reveal the stories of human creativity and labour that underly each one.

We can see the work that went into producing each object – their value lies not only in their beauty, but also in the time it took to extract the raw materials and the skills needed to work with wood, metal, stone and leather. New evidence is being uncovered about the Saka’s knowledge of both domesticated and wild plants and animals, the variety of different ways in which they occupied the land, and their role in the movement of objects and ideas  through long-distance contacts.



## Working with metals

East Kazakhstan is rich in minerals, and from at least 2000 BC its inhabitants mined rare tin deposits for bronze. The earliest gold artefacts also date to this time. The Saka were sophisticated metalworkers, drawing on the long tradition of metal working in the area. They also perfected skills in combining materials, such as bronze or wood with gold.



## Highlighting in gold

Saka smiths were skilled in working with other metals besides gold, especially bronze. Gold foiling serves to highlight the importance of beautifully made bronze artefacts, and gives them symbolic significance. Using a thin layer of gold may have been a way to signal the wealth of the wearer while retaining the functional properties of stronger materials.

## Iron torc or bracelet fragment in the shape of a snarling wolf head with gold leaf

Iron was a new material during Saka times. The gold leaf could be used to highlight the technical prowess of a Saka smith able to work with iron. Or it might represent an innovative way to use less gold while retaining a feeling of weight and wealth.

## Hidden stories

Finding broken and damaged artefacts can be very useful to archaeologists.

They may not look as beautiful but they give us the opportunity to look inside and view hidden information such as the internal structure or take tiny samples for analysis.

## Materials and material knowledge

By focusing on both how objects were made and the materials they were made from we can begin to understand the range and depth of skills and knowledge that Saka artisans possessed. We can see the hand of the smith or jeweller by looking closely at individual parts, and identifying the methods used to create them.

## Beads made of different materials

Gold beads require an exceptional knowledge of goldsmithing to produce. The Saka invested a lot of time and skill into their production. Carving stone is very different to working with gold. It is possible that each Saka craftsperson had their own material specialism.

## Earring

The Saka had access to a wide range of raw materials from the East Kazakhstan region. They knew where to find deposits of different semi-precious stones from their intimate knowledge of the landscape.

## Invisible stories

Analysis carried out during the preparation for this exhibition has revealed new information about the artefacts from Eleke Sazy. A non-destructive analytical technique called X-ray fluorescence has been used to determine the different elements found in the artefacts. A highpowered microscope revealed details invisible to the naked eye.

The artefacts associated with the burials from kurgans 4 and 7 were each made from a single batch of unalloyed gold containing only natural impurities. They were made using similar techniques, hammering, twisting, bending, and embossing for shaping, as well as granulation and inlays for decoration.

The artefacts from the hoard found under the stones of Kurgan 4 were fashioned from different gold. Were they deposited at a later date to commemorate the dead?

Further analysis is planned, and more exciting discoveries lie ahead.

## Coffin nails

Coffin nails, bronze burners and cauldrons from burials show us that Saka metalworking was not reserved for decoration or weaponry. There may be many more items from daily life that were made in metal which are yet to be discovered.

Animals and natural resources

From about 1000 BC people living in the steppe developed a specialised economy for their environment. Pastoral nomadism is based on moving mixed herds including horses, sheep and goats between the best seasonal grazing places. It is still practised by Kazakh nomads today. Besides milk, meat, and cheese, the Saka made the most of the wool and leather from their herds, as well as furs, skins and antlers from the wild animals they encountered. They also used wood from the surrounding hills, and reeds from wetlands to craft textiles, clothing, ornaments, weaponry and horse tack.

## Ceramic sherds with decorations and drilled holes

Excavations at the settlement site of Akbauyr have revealed that the Saka produced a range of different ceramics.

They used different clay types and decorations to produce a range of cooking and dining ware. Heavy duty crucibles which were used to melt metals have also been discovered.

## Plants and people

Recent research has demonstrated that the Saka used both wild and cultivated plants in their diet, medicine, craft, and ritual activity. Excavations at the Saka settlement of Akbauyr in East Kazakhstan have uncovered quern-stones used for grinding grain, and stone hoes used to prepare the ground for sowing seeds. Further analyses will aim to identify the types of plants they used. Evidence from other settlements, such as Tuzusai in south-east Kazakhstan, has shown that some Saka grew millet, barley and wheat.


## Pendants with granulated decoration

Appearing to be fruits or grains which might have had a special meaning for the Saka as imported delicacies. Another pendant in the shape of a bunch of grapes was found in the same hoard.

## Powerful plants

Study of ancient plant remains and written sources has shown that the Saka had a sophisticated knowledge of the medicinal and stimulant properties of plants. They had access to a rich natural medicine cabinet, in addition to those plants they may have cultivated themselves.

The ‘Urzhar priestess’ was buried with a wig made of grasses, and a variety of medicinal herbs. Ferns were known to have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and painrelieving properties. Cumin, thistle, and plantain were used for their bactericidal effect. Campion, used to treat poisoning and digestive issues, and cannabis for pain relief. In the wider Scythian world, finds of cannabis seeds with a burner from the Altai cemetery of Pazyryk show that it was used during funerary rituals. The Persians identified Saka ‘haoma-consumers’, an unknown plant with an intoxicating effect.



## Reconstruction of the burial costume of the Urzhar priestess

Buried with a magnificent golden headdress and a mortar for grinding the medicinal herbs that were placed in her grave. Her high status is linked with her skills as a herbalist, and indicates that Saka respect for the natural world extended to plants as well as animals.

## Signalling status

The Saka signalled the social status of those they buried through clothing adornments, horse harnesses and weaponry. Exquisite pieces demonstrated that individuals and their families could command the time of skilled artisans and acquire precious materials and new fashions through longdistance trade networks. Both men and women were buried with high status objects.



## Opium poppy-head hair pin

A split in the gold reveals something inside, perhaps once a real poppy head was encased in gold. First cultivated in the Mediterranean, the opium poppy travelled east with Alexander the Great. Its presence points to the long-distance trade networks that were available to the elite Saka woman who was buried with it.

## WHOSE TRUTH?

We can build a picture of the past based on our understanding of artefacts, cemeteries, settlements, written text, animal and plant remains. How we interpret the past often reveals the things that are important to us and our society today. So whose truth are we telling when we speak about the past?

Archaeologists uncover new data, which may challenge or reinforce their previous interpretations. Museums present complex information in a way that can be understood by a wide audience. Governments create monuments. People may feel drawn to certain objects more than others based on their own experiences and histories.

The Saka hold a special place in the Republic of Kazakhstan today, and their kurgans remain a dominant feature in the landscape. We may find many truths in what the Saka mean to us, both within and beyond the borders of Kazakhstan.

## Before and after the Saka

The steppe was occupied for thousands of years before the emergence of the Saka in around 1,000 BC. Some of the earliest expressions of Saka culture and what we call the Scythian ‘animal style’ come from the Altai region. The age of the Saka began to dwindle from around 200 BC, and they were later replaced by Xianbei-Hun tribes from further east. These new inhabitants adopted and adapted Saka customs, asserting their claim to the land by burying their dead alongside Saka kurgans. The legacy of the Saka is still felt in Kazakhstan today.



## Saka artefacts on modern currency

Elements of Saka culture resonate with traditional Kazakh nomadic culture, which suffered through forced collectivisation in the early Soviet period. The Saka are an important part of the past to be reclaimed as part of building a new independent identity, highlighting threads of shared experience across millennia.

The only other intact Saka burial found on the territory of Kazakhstan now stands on a monumental column in Republic Square in the city of Almaty.

## Meet the archaeologists

All the artefacts in this exhibition were excavated by archaeologists from Kazakhstan. The year 2021 marks 30 years of independence for the Republic of Kazakhstan. Recent investment in archaeological research by the regional government of East Kazakhstan has led to outstanding discoveries. The excavation teams are led by Prof Zainolla Samashev and Prof Abdesh Toleubayev.

A new programme of Saka kurgan excavation in the post-Soviet period in East Kazakhstan began in 1998 when Prof Samashev of Nazarbayev University made extraordinary discoveries at the Berel cemetery. Prof Toleubayev of Al-Farabi Kazakh National University has led excavations at the Shilikti valley since 2003, discovering thousands of outstanding gold Saka artefacts from burials dating from the 8th to the 1st centuries BC. Since 2018 excavations have been conducted at the cemetery of Eleke Sazy, as well as the settlement of Akbauyr. Their research is ongoing.


## An unfolding story

Excavations are ongoing in East Kazakhstan, and new discoveries are being made every year. Archaeologists are also working against the threat of looters, who have severely damaged kurgans at Eleke Sazy.

The cemetery of Eleke Sazy continued to be a sacred place long after the Saka. Excavations in the summer of 2021 have opened the next chapter in East Kazakhstan’s history book. At a temple complex dating from around 600-700 AD, 1500 years later than the young archer’s burial in Kurgan , items of weaponry and ceremonial costumes have been found. Most impressive is a belt plaque showing a Turkic Qaghan, or emperor, sitting on a throne with horse-head arm rests. At his feet attendants kneel to serve him.



## A life cut short, a story left untold...

A weaving tablet found alone among the scattered bones of the young teenage girl whose grave was plundered by looters. The boy archer beside her in Eleke Sazy Kurgan 4 remained hidden, untouched. Was she skilled in weaving? A warrior in the making? What else was she buried with? Though her voice is almost silenced, it reminds us about all those whose truth we cannot speak.
